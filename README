Provides filetype, syntax, and indenting for OAL (Object Action Language) files. OAL is used with the BridgePoint UML modeling tool available from Mentor Graphics.
This also supports archetype files for BridgePoint, as they use much of the same syntax as OAL.

Files named *.oal and *.arc will be automatically recognized.
