Provides filetype, syntax, and indenting for OAL (Object Action Language) files. OAL is used with the BridgePoint UML modeling tool available from Mentor Graphics.

Files named *.oal will be automatically recognized.

NOTE: At the present, the BridgePoint editor can't be fully replaced by Vim, so be sure to load changes back into the BridgePoint editor before updating any names in the model!
